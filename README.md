# Freuder v 3.00

## Under Construction


### To do: 

 - `SSL issue`
 - `Message` model join table vs. polymorphic class decision
 - Non-generic controller actions specs
 - Non-generic model method specs

### Description:

Freuder is an add-on for Twitter, which uses API calls to pull user's Twitter feed. The app allows finding and saving tweets that match a certain specified criteria. For example, if I am a PR Firm, looking to do an outreach to publications within the automotive industry, I can create a filter for terms “car”, “auto” and “article”, and find and save tweets that feature this combination of terms (in any order).
