### Description:

Freuder is an add-on for Twitter, which uses API calls to pull user's Twitter feed. The app allows finding and saving tweets that match a certain specified criteria. For example, if I am a PR pro, looking to do an outreach to publications within the automotive industry, I can create a filter for terms “car”, “auto” and “article”, and find and save tweets that feature this combination of terms (in any order).

### How to use:
1. Sign-in with your twitter account
2. Create your first filter ("+Create New Filter)
3. Specify the "slips" you want to listen to, and separate them by comma
4. Go to "All Messages" tab and hit "Refresh". 
5. Your "Filtered Messages" tab will show the number of tweets that matched your filter. You can also filter through the existing list of messages by going to "Filtered Messages" tab and clicking "Analyze Current Messages"
